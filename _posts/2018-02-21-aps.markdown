I'll be giving a talk at the APS March Meeting in Los Angeles on March 6, at 11:50 AM. My presentation will be titled [Controlling multiphoton absorption in Dirac materials via pulse shaping][APS].

On a side note, I am now pursuing my 2D materials research in the [R. Martel group][UDM] in the Department of Chemistry, Universit&eacute; of Montr&eacute;al.
