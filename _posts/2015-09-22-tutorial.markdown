My latest article was recently published as a Tutorial in J. Opt. The title is *Lorenz-Mie theory for 2D scattering and resonance calculations*. It can be downloaded [here][Paper], and the preprint [here][Preprint]. It is a condensed version of a numerical method I used in my doctoral thesis.

The article is concerned with a description of the two-dimensional generalized Lorenz-Mie theory (2D-GLMT), a well-established numerical method used to compute the interaction of light with arrays of cylinders.  I hope that new researchers or graduate students can find a useful resource in this article. Enjoy!
