After almost a year in the making, our latest article was published in [Phys. Rev. Lett][Paper]. In this work, I use a combination of metaheuristics and Floquet theory to demonstrate control over quantum system via pulse shape optimization in the spectral domain. Writing this Letter was lots of fun!
