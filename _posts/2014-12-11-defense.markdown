Last Thursday, I successfully defended my doctoral thesis, titled "Generalized Lorenz-Mie Theory: Application to scattering and eigenmodes of photonic structures". The full text of the thesis is available the [website][dynamica] of my research group. 

I will be pursuing my research as a postdoctoral fellow at INRS-EMT in a few months. Stay tuned for more details!
