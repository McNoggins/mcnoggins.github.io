I am a PhD candidate in Physics at Universit&eacute; Laval, Canada. I am a member of Prof. Louis J. Dub&eacute;'s research group.

Research interests
====================

My main research area is computational electromagnetics. More specifically, I am interested in using metaheuristics to optimize integrated photonics devices. Lately, I have worked on designing beam shaping devices using photonic crystals.

I am also interested in modeling complex photonic media, including photonic microresonators and random lasers.

See my publications page for further details.
