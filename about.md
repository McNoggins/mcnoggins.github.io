I am a physics graduate from Universit&eacute; Laval, Canada. I graduated from [Prof. Louis J. Dub&eacute;'s group][dynamica] in 2014. I am now working as a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at Université de Montréal, Canada. You will find more about my research interests and my work on this webpage.

Research interests
====================

My main research area is electromagnetic theory and lasers. My doctoral work was concerned with using metaheuristic algorithms to optimize integrated photonics devices. I have also worked on designing beam shaping devices using photonic crystals.

I am also interested in complex photonic media, including photonic microresonators and random lasers, as well as quantum optics.

In recent years, I have been working on light-matter interactions and 2D materials (specifically graphene).

See my [publications](/publications), [Google Scholar][scholar] profile or [ORCID][orcid] for further details.
